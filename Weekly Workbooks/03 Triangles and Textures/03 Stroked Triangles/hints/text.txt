Use the standard C <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/" target="_blank">rand</a> function to help. This function returns a random integer between 0 and 32767 (depending on platform !). In order to bring this integer into a desired range, we can use the modulus operator `%`. For example `rand()%256` will give us a random number in the range 0-255.

Note that the `CanvasTriangle` class also overrides the `<<` operator so that you can direct them straight to `cout` for debugging purposes.
