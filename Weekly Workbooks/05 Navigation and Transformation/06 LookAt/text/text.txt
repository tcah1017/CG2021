The problem with the "orbit" feature above is that you will soon lose sight of the model. This is because, although the camera _position_ is orbiting, the camera _orientation_ remains the same (so the camera will always be looking off in the same direction). To solve this problem, you should implement a `lookAt` function as described in the above slides and audio narration. This function should take a single parameter - a point in 3D space that the camera should "look at" (point towards).

You should call your new `lookAt` function each time your "orbit" code has changed the position of the camera. By passing in the centre of the scene as a parameter, the `lookAt` function will ensure that the camera is _always_ oriented towards the centre of the scene so that the Cornell Box model will always remain visible. See the animation linked to above for a demonstration of the effect that you should be trying to achieve (note: there is no audio narration for this particular animation !)
