It soon becomes a pain to have to manually move the camera around the scene using the keyboard each time we want to get a different perspective on a scene. To ease this problem (and to make testing of your renderer easier) we will now include some additional code that automatically animates the position of the camera.

More specifically, add some code to your project that rotates ("orbits") the position on the camera (about the Y axis) around the centre of the Cornell Box. See the animation linked to above for an illustration of what you are aiming to achieve - this is a view from above showing the orbiting of the camera around the model (note that there is no audio narration in this video).

Implementing the "orbit" feature will involve applying a very small rotational transformation to the _camera position_ every time your code iterates through the main loop. As such, you could put the additional "orbit" code inside the loop in the `main` method, however it is tidier to put it inside the `draw` function (which already gets called during each iteration of the loop).
